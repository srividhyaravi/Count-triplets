# Count-triplets

<pre>
To find the triplets in an ordered doubly linked ls whose sum is equal to a given value, we must use three pointer variables called ptr1, ptr2 and ptr3. 
The ordered doubly linked list sorts the numbers in ascending order. 
The three pointers are used to traverse through the list. 
If the summation of the data parts of the three pointers is equal to the value of the key entered, the triplets are found and displayed. 
Otherwise, the triplets do not exist for the given key value and hence is not displayed.
